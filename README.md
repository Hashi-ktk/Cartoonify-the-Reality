# Cartoonify the Image

A python application that will transform an image into its cartoon using OpenCV

**Algorithms:** 
* Thresholding technique
* K Means Clustering




**Filters:** 
* Bilateral Filter
* Contours
* erode
* Canny(edge detection)

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
```
easygui
